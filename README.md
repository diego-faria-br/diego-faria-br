# About Me


I'm passionate about making information understandable for everyone. Most of my career is dedicated to delivering high-level quantitative models using the best tools available in Excel, Python, and R. Currently as a Finances Analyst, I translate quantitative economic data into insightful reports. I also bring experience as an Energy Analyst, where I conducted quantitative analysis on the supply and demand of oil, gas, and renewable fuels.

Here, my intention is to show some finished projects on Python or R. I also show some projects that are not yet deployed just waiting for the right time to come out!
