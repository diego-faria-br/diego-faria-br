# About Me


I'm passionate about making information understandable for everyone. Most of my career is dedicated to delivering high-level quantitative models using the best tools available in Excel, Python, and R. Currently as a Finances Analyst, I translate quantitative economic data into insightful reports. I also bring experience as an Energy Analyst, where I conducted quantitative analysis on the supply and demand of oil, gas, and renewable fuels.

Here, my intention is to show some finished projects on Python or R. I also show some projects that are not yet deployed just waiting for the right time to come out!


## [Twitter Web Scrapper - Information Transparency - Aggregates Information of Potential Fake News](https://github.com/bruno-ponne/Alethea)



Using Python programming, we developed a web application to aggregate news from the U.S. elections in 2020. The project was divided in three modules. The first module uses a Twitter API to gather information from media accounts on twitter, the second module makes analysis and relates the presidential candidates to the frequency of fake news, and the last module publishes the information in a web format.

## [Student Loan Default Predictor - Machine Learning Project](https://github.com/cbsobral/ml-fies)

In this project, two colleagues and I built a Student Loan Default Predictor using machine learning algorithms. We analyzed data from Brazil's most significant student loan program to see how default probability correlates to many other variables, such as the university course, region of the country, proportion of the tuition paid by the loan, etc. We used the scikit-learrn module for python and applied different machine learning algorithms.

## Analysis of the Brazilian Foreign Trade Over Time

This is an ongoing project. The idea is to show some nice vizualizations on the Brazilian imports and exports over time.
